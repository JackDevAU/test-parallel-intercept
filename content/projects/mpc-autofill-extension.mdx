**Aim**: Extend the base functionality of MPC Fill to allow multiple decks to be parsed with different card backs.&#x20;

This was another weekend project that was used to add the ability to MPC Fill to print multiple decks with different card backs. To make this process easier, I also created the above website to generate the `.xml` file. This was the first time I'd experimented with the VSCode in the browser package and found it surprisingly easy to implement and extremely powerful!&#x20;
