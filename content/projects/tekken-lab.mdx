This was a fun project made over a weekend as I couldn't find a good solution at the time. It needs a lot more work, but is in a beta position.&#x20;

Some interesting things to note, this was my first "real" project using Keystatic in production. This was a fun look into what Keystatic could do and the limitations I found when using it. Since creating this site - Keystatic has been developed and a lot of the issues I ran into have now been fixed.&#x20;
